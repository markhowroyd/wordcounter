Word Counter Application

Assumptions:
Translator and top level application will need to provide some indication of input language, 
otherwise words may be ambiguous e.g. "chat" may be an English word or else French for "cat". This is a
case where, in a real system, requirements should be expanded appropriately and work done to the
translator (API) in collaboration with the 3rd party team, or alternate translator used. The upshot of
not doing this is to record a significant number of potentially incorrect counts.
